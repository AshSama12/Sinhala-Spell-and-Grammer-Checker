# 🌐 Sinhala Grammar Correction System

This repository contains a **rule-based Sinhala grammar correction system** that analyzes a dataset of correct Sinhala sentences, generates grammatical rules, and applies them to correct user inputs. 📝✨

---

## ✨ Features
- 📜 **Extracts rules** from a dataset of grammatically correct Sinhala sentences.
- 🧩 **Tokenizes and analyzes patterns** (word frequencies and bigrams).
- 🤖 **Interactive corrections**: Applies the extracted rules to correct user-entered Sinhala paragraphs.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **📁 Dataset**: The system uses a dataset containing only correct Sinhala sentences (e.g., `grammerRule1.txt`).
2. **🛠️ Rule Generation**: Analyzes tokenized sentences to identify word frequencies and bigram patterns.
3. **🖊️ User Input**: Accepts a Sinhala paragraph from the user and applies the generated rules to provide corrections.

---

## 🚀 Usage
1. Place your dataset file (`grammerRule1.txt`) in the project directory.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python grammar_correction.py
   ```
3. Enter a Sinhala paragraph when prompted.
4. The corrected paragraph will be displayed.

## Dataset Format
- The dataset should contain only correct Sinhala sentences, one sentence per line.
- Example:
  ```
  මම පාසලට ගියා.
  අපි ගමේ වෙළඳසැලට ගියා.
  ```

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Required libraries: `re`, `collections`, `sklearn`

Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
